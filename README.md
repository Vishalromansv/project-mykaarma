A conversational AI agent built with Next.js, Google Gemini, and Supabase that helps users discover, compare, and learn about mobile phones.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Natural Language Search:** Understands user queries for phones based on budget, brand, and specific features (e.g., "best camera phone under ‚Çπ30k").
* **Database-Grounded Responses:** Uses a Supabase (PostgreSQL) database to provide factual, accurate product information, preventing AI hallucinations.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean, responsive chat interface built with Next.js that displays both text responses and rich product cards with images.
* **Safety & Adversarial Handling:** Gracefully refuses off-topic or malicious requests to ensure a focused and safe user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

1.  The user sends a message from the **Next.js frontend**.
2.  The backend API route receives the message and sends it to the **Google Gemini** model.
3.  Gemini interprets the user's intent and decides to call the `find_phones` function.
4.  The backend executes this function, which queries the **Supabase** database for relevant phone data.
5.  The retrieved data is sent back to Gemini.
6.  Gemini uses this data to generate a final, natural-language response, which is then sent back to the user.

This ensures that the AI's responses are always based on the factual data stored in the database.
